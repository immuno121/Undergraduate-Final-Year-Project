Donation Prediction using Machine Learning

The current scenario of charitable donations under various schemes and promotional measures is based on the sentiments of the donors and potential donors. There are a number of NGOs working for the same and have the traditional model of advertising and getting donations. Data mining techniques can be used to make methods of donation promotion more intuitive and efficient. The transactional data can be used and data mining can be done to get detailed insight into the donation patterns, influences and sentiments.

I developed predictive model to analyze the relation of multiple donor parameters and predict the potential donation values for each donor. This model can be then used for suggestion and amount recommendation schemes to improve reach and amounts gathered.
